    <h2>Simply Put, I Like Everything Sometimes</h2>
    <p>I used to say I like everything but country, but them I started to like country.</p>
    <p>I enjoy electronic dance music, and listen on DI.FM</p>
    <p>A genre of music I like to ask people about is Nerd Core. Have you heard of it? It's basically nerdy rap. If you are starting a Pandora station I would suggest starting it off with MC Frontalot</p>
