    <h2>Making Pizza Art</h2>
    <p>I've never been able to make pizza from scratch at home despite having worked at a pizza place and made exellent pizza very efficently. But while working I got the idea to make art out of pizza.</p>

    <p>This pizza is a butterfly, I spinked bellpepers on it's wings for color, using tomato slices to make the edge of the wings more colorful. I put some jalapeno slices down tht middle for the body and olives for the eyes and mouth.</p>

    <p>I was a Cingular Wireless subscriber at the time and there was a store close to where I worked. It's really just a shapped Pepperoni Pizza.</p>
